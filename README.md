# CGL

Assignment 1 - Install and explore OpenGL (polygon_with_line.cpp).

Assignment 2 - Implement DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithm to draw simple, dotted, dashed, and solid line using mouse interface. Divide the screen in four quadrants with center as (0, 0) (The line should work for all the slopes positive as well as negative).

Assignment 3 - Implement Bresenham circle drawing algoritm to draw any object. The object should be displayed in all quadrants with respect to center and radius. Create a menu(on OpenGL window and not terminal) with the following options: Draw, Clear, Fill(Implement later), and Exit. First click registers the center and second click will be used to calculate the radius of the circle. Change p=[3-2r,1-r], p<0, p>0 etc.
